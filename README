Bash Bignum
A Bignum solution implemented in pure Bash
http://github.com/ess/bashbignum

PURPOSE
=======

Aside from giving me the ability to claim to be a Big Jerk (TM), I guess there
are situations in which it would be somewhat awesome to be able to handle
ridiculously large integers (and their calculations) in a pure Bash environment.

Remember ... we can't always guarantee that bc will exist on a given system.

If you can believe this, I actually have a project in mind for which this
capability is an absolute requirement.

FEATURES
========

* Integers so large that they can fill up the entirety of your memory, if you
  so choose.

* Addition!

* Subtraction!

* Multiplication!

* Division!

* Modulo Division!

* Negation!

* Intuitive Comparisons!

* While the arithmetic operations are about as well-optimized as I could figure,
  Bash Bignum caluculations are Awesomely Slow.

BASICS
======

source /path/to/bignum.sh

a="$( bn_create '100000000000000000000000000000000000')"
b="$( bn_create '10000000000000000000000000000000000')"

echo "$( bn_to_string "$( bn_add "${a}" "${b}" )" )"

echo "Read through the source until I've had time to document this crap."
